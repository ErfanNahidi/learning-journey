# 🩸 SQL Injection Roadmap

## 🎯 Goal
Master SQL Injection vulnerabilities — from theory to real-world exploitation — and understand how to secure applications against them.

---

## 🔗 Primary Source
**[SQL Injection Academy - PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)**  
Status: 🔲 Not started

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Introduction to SQLi
- Retrieving hidden data
- UNION-based SQLi
- Error-based SQLi
- Blind SQL injection (Boolean-based, Time-based)
- Out-of-band (OOB) SQLi
- Bypassing filters
- Exploiting different DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL)

---

## 🛠️ Practice Labs
✅ Interactive labs included (Burp Academy-style)  
🎯 Complete each lab and document what payloads were used and why they worked.

---

## 🧠 Complementary Learning
- Study: `OWASP Top 10 - Injection`
- Tools: sqlmap, Burp Suite
- Read: *The Tangled Web* — SQLi chapters
- Practice: Create a vulnerable lab with SQLite, then escalate
